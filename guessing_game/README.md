# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple terminal-based number guessing game written in Python for beginner practice and portfolio development.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- The user is asked to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program gives feedback:
  - Too low? ➡️ "You guessed too low!"
  - Too high? ➡️ "You guessed too high!"
- The game keeps track of how many guesses the user took.
- Once guessed correctly, the program congratulates the player and shows the total number of attempts.
- The user is then asked if they want to play again.

## 🧪 Features

- Validates the user’s input format using `int()`.
- Loops the game until the user decides to exit.
- Tracks and displays the number of attempts.
- Uses Python's built-in `random` module.

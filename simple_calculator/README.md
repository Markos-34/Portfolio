# Simple Python Calculator üßÆ

This is a basic command-line calculator built in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations by choosing from a menu.

## üöÄ Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with zero division handling)
- Power
- Exit option to end the program

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The user is presented with a menu of options.
2. The user selects a number from 1 to 6.
3. If an operation (1-5) is selected:
   - The program prompts for two numbers.
   - It performs the chosen calculation and displays the result.
4. If `6` is selected, the program exits.
5. If division by zero is attempted, the program shows a warning instead of crashing.

## üìÇ File

- `calculator.py`: The main script file containing the code.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run It

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python calculator.py
